    <p>
        SmartPollutionWatch is a web-based platform designed to predict air pollution levels and
        provide accessible insights into air quality trends, beginning with Downtown Los Angeles.
        Developed by team AirSight, the project uses historical air quality data collected via the
        Environmental API (EAP) to train machine learning models that forecast concentrations of major
        pollutants and overall AQI.
    </p>
    
    <p>This website allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>View predicted pollutant levels and AQI in a clear, visual format.</li>
        <li>Explore historical data through interactive tables and charts.</li>
        <li>Upload their own air quality readings to compare or contribute to model improvement.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        The system focuses on practical functionality, combining data-driven forecasting with a user-friendly
        interface. By enabling both exploration and contribution, SmartPollutionWatch serves
        as a useful tool for individuals, researchers, and communities who want to stay informed and
        proactive about environmental conditions.

    <h2 class="section-title">Project Goals</h2>
    <h3 class="goal-title">Build and test a machine learning model that can predict air quality</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Specific:</strong> Train and evaluate at least two machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for AQI prediction using publicly available datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Achieve an RÂ² score of at least 0.75 on the test dataset.</li>
        <li><strong>Achievable:</strong> We have access to the required data and skills to execute this task.</li>
        <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Model accuracy is essential for providing reliable forecasts.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Complete model training and evaluation by end of July.</li>
    </ul>
